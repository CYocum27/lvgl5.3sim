# Visual Studio 2017 using SDL on x64 architecture


A pre-configured Visual Studio Project to try LittlevGL on PC. The project uses the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library which is copied and linked to the project, so you can compile it without any extra steps. The 64 bit libraries are used so it will work out-of-the-box on 64-bit systems.
